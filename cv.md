## Projects

### Demand Forecasting System
*Python, pandas, statsmodels, Prophet, scikit-learn*

Built multi-product retail demand forecasting system with business impact quantification. Implemented baseline, statistical (ARIMA, Prophet), and ML approaches (XGBoost with engineered features). Reduced forecast error by 18% vs baseline, quantified 12% potential inventory cost savings.

### Squad Optimization Framework
*Python, PuLP, SQL, PCA*

Developed constraint-based optimization using Mixed Integer Linear Programming to maximize team performance under role and formation constraints. Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction (10+ features → 3 style components). Generated optimal squads with 15% performance improvement.

### Hate Speech Monitoring System
*Python, scikit-learn, FastAPI, Docker*

Built production content moderation system for 800k records with <10% minority class. Achieved 85% recall, 61% precision using TF-IDF + LinearSVC. Implemented Platt scaling for probability calibration and 3-tier confidence-based routing. Deployed as Dockerized FastAPI service with JSONL logging.

### Route Optimization (In Progress)
*Python, OR-Tools, Constraint Programming*

Implementing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) for last-mile delivery optimization. Comparing exact methods vs heuristics, targeting 20%+ distance reduction.
