# About Me

I'm a computational problem solver transitioning from physics research to data science, with focus on optimization and quantitative analysis.

For three years, I tackled complex scientific computing problems—processing millions of data points, building optimization algorithms, and developing automated analysis pipelines. Now I'm applying these skills to business problems: demand forecasting, operational optimization, and data-driven decision making.

**What I bring:**
- Strong foundation in mathematical modeling and optimization (MILP, constraint programming)
- Experience processing and analyzing large-scale datasets (10M+ records)
- Production-ready Python development (Docker, FastAPI, automated pipelines)
- Scientific rigor in problem-solving and experimentation

**Current focus:** Building expertise in time series forecasting and supply chain optimization.
