# About Me

I build forecasting systems and optimization solutions for complex business problems.

Currently transitioning from computational physics research to industry data science. I spent three years solving large-scale computational problems—processing millions of data points, building optimization algorithms, and developing automated analysis pipelines. Now I apply these skills to demand forecasting, operations research, and production ML systems.

I enjoy solving problems with data, whether that's forecasting demand to optimize inventory, building constraint-based optimization for resource allocation, or deploying production ML systems. My approach combines mathematical rigor with practical business impact.

My current work typically includes time series forecasting, operations research (MILP, routing, inventory optimization), and production ML deployment. I also enjoy mentoring and knowledge sharing with others transitioning into data science.

**What I bring:**
- Strong foundation in mathematical modeling and optimization
- Experience with large-scale data processing and analysis
- Production-ready Python development (Docker, FastAPI, automated pipelines)
- Scientific rigor in problem-solving and experimentation

**Currently learning:** Advanced time series methods, supply chain analytics, and MLOps best practices.
