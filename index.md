## About

I spent three years solving large-scale computational problems in physics research - processing millions of data points, building optimization algorithms, and automating complex analysis pipelines. Now I apply these skills to business problems: forecasting demand, optimizing operations, and deploying production ML systems.

**What I bring:**
- Mathematical rigor in problem formulation
- Experience with large-scale data processing (10M+ records)
- Production-ready development (Docker, FastAPI, Git)
- Deep focus on optimization (MILP, constraint programming)

**Currently learning:** Advanced time series methods (ARIMA, Prophet, SARIMAX), inventory theory, supply chain analytics.
