## Experience

### Scientific Researcher
**IPCMS, University of Strasbourg** | Strasbourg, France  
*October 2022 — October 2025*

- Conducted large-scale micromagnetic simulations to characterize spin-wave dynamics (magnonics) in complex 3D structures, including Möbius strips, helicoids, and magnonic crystals
- Developed Python scripts to process high-dimensional magnetization vector fields from Finite Element Meshes (FEM); implemented data binning, spatial interpolation, and 2D Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) to extract magnonic dispersion spectra from topologically complex structures
- **Publication:** "Rotating Spin Wave Modes in Nanoscale Möbius Strips" (NPJ Spintronics, 4, Article number: 4 (2026))

## Projects

### Role Aware Squad Optimization
**Technologies:** Python, SQL, MILP (PuLP), PCA

- Developed constraint-based optimization framework using Mixed Integer Linear Programming to maximize performance metrics under role and formation constraints
- Dimensionality reduction via PCA: transformed 10+ correlated performance features into 3 interpretable style components
- Structured player and match data in a SQL database, creating optimized views for downstream analytics and model inputs

### Hate Speech Monitoring System
**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-Learn, FastAPI, Docker

- Built confidence-based content moderation system routing 800k records with <10% minority class, achieving 85% recall with 61% precision on hate speech detection
- Systematic model selection: benchmarked 4 approaches (SMOTE, oversampling, embeddings, TF-IDF), selected TF-IDF+LinearSVC for speed-accuracy tradeoff
- Implemented Platt scaling for probability calibration; designed 3-tier routing system flagging uncertain predictions (0.3-0.7 confidence) for continuous model improvement
- Production deployment: Dockerized FastAPI service with JSONL logging for failure mode analysis
