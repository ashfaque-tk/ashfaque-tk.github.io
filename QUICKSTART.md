## Having Issues?

**Photo not showing?**
- Check filename is exactly `profile.jpg`
- Verify it's in `assets/images/` folder
- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild

## What's Different From Standard Portfolios?

✅ **Sidebar layout** - Not a standard blog theme  
✅ **Profile photo** - More personal and memorable  
✅ **Horizontal nav** - Modern, intuitive navigation  
✅ **Clean About page** - Simple intro, not overwhelming  

This matches professional DS portfolios like Maggie Wolff's.
