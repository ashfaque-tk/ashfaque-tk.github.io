# About Me

Hi, I’m Ashfaque. I’m transitioning from computational physics into data science, with a focus on demand forecasting and operations research.

Right now, I’m building depth in time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet), optimization (MILP, routing, inventory problems), and production-oriented ML workflows. I’m particularly interested in systems where predictions directly inform decisions — forecasting demand, allocating inventory, and planning logistics.

During my PhD at IPCMS (University of Strasbourg), I worked on micromagnetic simulations of complex 3D curved structures — including Möbius-strip-like geometries — to study how spin waves behave in unconventional shapes. Spin waves are being explored for next-generation spintronic and low-energy computing technologies, and our goal was to understand whether geometry alone could be used to control them.

I ran large finite element simulations and built tools to extract high-dimensional magnetization data from FEM meshes, turning raw simulation outputs into interpretable dispersion plots. You can find the published work [https://doi.org/10.1038/s44306-025-00118-8.]

I write about forecasting, optimization, and navigating the shift from academia to industry — sharing what I’m learning along the way.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and playing football
